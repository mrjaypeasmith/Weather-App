# Weather-App
freeCodeCamp Weather App

I finally completed this challenge.  I am quite pleased with parts of it, whereas others definitely need some improvement.

I enjoy the icons if found, created by the awesome Erik Flowers [Weather icons](http://erikflowers.github.io/weather-icons/)

I had some issues with CSS Grid and understadning the media queries.  I wanted to use more HTML5 tags, but they didn't seem to play well with the media query.  

I'd also like to add some animations to the page load.  I'm inspired by Theo Favereau's design [Weather UI - Material Design](https://dribbble.com/shots/2209918-Weather-UI-Material-Design)
